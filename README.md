# stockmp
Predicting stock prices is difficult due to the non-linear nature of time-series data.  Implemented a LSTM RNN in python. Key skills Demonstrated: Python, TensorFlow, Time-Series Data Preprocessing (MinMaxScaler), (matplotlib), and (yfinance).

# How to Run the Project
This project is best viewed and executed in a Jupyter environment.
Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the data fetching, model training, and final prediction chart.
